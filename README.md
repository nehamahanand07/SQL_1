# SQL_1

INTRODUCTION:
In this SQL project, I have tried to analyse a dataset which was publicly available, trying to find insights using queries. The project mainly focus on data filtering, cleaning and the use of joins to find relations between the different files with same field names or filed values!

DATA:
The data was taken from The portalÂ , which is a central point of access to European open data from international, European Union, national, regional, local and geodata portals. It consolidates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.
it is Open Data release of Library Data for Cambridgeshire. Dataset includes: Events, Loans, Mobile Library Routes, Library Opening Times and Physical Visits.
